# machine-learning-challenge
I tried 2 models: SVM and deep learning.
SVM has almost 85% accuracy and deep learning almost 90% accuracy.
For SVM choosing 'C': 50 and 'gamma': 0.0001, makes 88% accuracy.
For Deep learning, with 2 layers of 100 units and epochs 100, model accuracy is 88% to 90%. With epochs=150 with unit=100, best score is: %88
and with 200 units for each layer and epochs 200, I see almost same best score.
Both models I chose had almost same result, even deep learning is little bit better in score but SVM is faster to run,
I also noticed that Logistics regression and random forest are little bit better but they are not higher that %90 score as well.
